    "\n",
    "This manual aims to standardize the language used by models when describing human poses and motions, making it more precise and specific while avoiding vague and abstract expressions. By employing a unified set of terms, phrases, and descriptive standards, it ensures that the content generated by the model is clear and consistent, making it easier for readers to understand and apply.\n",

    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, accurately describing human motion is crucial for the training and application of models. This manual provides a comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines to assist models in generating precise human motion descriptions, avoiding ambiguity and vagueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Basic Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**: Descriptions should be as specific as possible, providing clear angles, directions, positions, and motion details.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Use a uniform set of terms and phrases to ensure the descriptions are coherent and comprehensible.\n",
    "- **Objectivity**: Avoid subjective evaluations or emotional tones, focusing on the statement of objective facts.\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: Expressions should be brief and to the point, highlighting key information while avoiding redundancy.\n",

    "  - **Example**: *“The thigh is nearly vertical to the ground.”*\n",
    "- **Diagonal**: 30° < Angle ≤ 60°\n",
    "  - **Example**: *“The arm extends at a 45-degree angle to the front side.”*\n",
    "- **Near Horizontal**: 60° < Angle ≤ 80°\n",
    "  - **Example**: *“The lower leg is nearly horizontal.”*\n",
    "- **Horizontal**: Angle > 80°\n",
    "  - **Example**: *“The arms are extended horizontally to the sides.”*\n",

    "**Direction Descriptions:**\n",
    "\n",

    "Editing command: to help improve `description1` so it more closely matches `description2`.\n",
    "1. **Comparison**:\n",
    "    - Compare the descriptions for each body part mentioned above. Focus on specific aspects of the motion, such as:\n",
    "        - **Movement**: How the body part is moving (e.g., raised, lowered, rotated).\n",
    "        - **Direction**: In which direction the movement occurs (e.g., upward, downward, forward, backward).\n",
    "        - **Intensity**: Is the movement fast or slow? Sudden or smooth?\n",
    "        - **Positioning**: The final position of the body part (e.g., shoulder height, bent at the knee).\n",
    "    - If a body part is mentioned in `description2` but not in `description1`, note that as a discrepancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feedback**:\n",
    "    - For each body part, if a discrepancy is found, generate **one** piece of feedback that includes:\n",
    "        - **Body part**: Identify which body part the feedback is for (e.g., left arm, right leg, spine).\n",
    "        - **Issue**: Briefly describe the difference between `description1` and `description2` for this body part.\n",
    "        - **Suggested Change**: Provide a clear, actionable suggestion to adjust `description1` to match `description2`. Be specific about how the movement should be changed.\n",
    "    - Ensure that only one piece of feedback is given for each body part, even if there are multiple issues. Prioritize the most significant discrepancy.\n",
